# Main is an entrypoint used by setuptools to tie the name of wrapper script
# that it creates for our Command Line program without the ``.py`` extension to
# the code we would normally want to run the program was invoked. This assumes
# that we are building a command line utility and not just a library.
# If we are only building and packing a library, this is unnecessary.
# We should not have any business logic here, that belongs in the library. This
# makes testing easier in general, because it reduces or eliminates any need to
# test the main entrypoint.
#
# When this main_func is called, it is effectively referenced as:
# pypkgexp1.cli.main_func.
